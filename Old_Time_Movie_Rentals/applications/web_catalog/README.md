# Web Report Interface

Interface for viewing reports, recent transactions, and available rentals.

## About

This application was written in [React](https://reactjs.org/), a web framework developed by Facebook. It is front-end only, so we have to use a back-end API in order to provide the front end with dynamic data. [See API](https://github.com/The1TrueJoe/Database-Case-Studies/tree/main/Old_Time_Movie_Rentals/applications/backend-api)
